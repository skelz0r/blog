Configure ActiveStorage with OpenStack can be a little bit tricky, this blog post
explains how to configure it with OVH.

In this tutorial, we're going to:
1. Setup a private bucket on OVH
1. Install and setup ActiveStorage OpenStack
1. Configure user access
1. Configure temporary url key, required by OpenStack
1. üçπ

This setup has been tested on rails 6.x, but it should work with rails >= 5.2.2
(as specified in [ActiveStorage::OpenStack
gemspec](https://github.com/chaadow/activestorage-openstack/blob/master/activestorage-openstack.gemspec#L25))

## 1. Setup Object Storage on OVH Public Cloud

First, you have to create a new public cloud project in order to use Object
Storage.

Follow [this link](https://www.ovh.com/manager/public-cloud/#/pci/projects/new)
in order to start. You should have the screen below üëá

{% asset 'activestorage-ovh/create-public-cloud-project.png' %}

Enter a project name and a credit card in order to create your project.

When your new project is ready, click on the **Object Storage** link in the side
panel.

{% asset 'activestorage-ovh/create-object-container.png' %}

Click on the **Create an object storage** call to action, then:

1. Choose a location (like _Strasbourg (SBG)_)
1. Choose a type of container (_Private_ or _Public_)
1. Choose a name for your container

For the example, I choose Strasbourg, a private bucket and
`example-private-bucket` as name :

{% asset 'activestorage-ovh/example-private-bucket-created.png' %}

At this point you have created a bucket which can be used in ActiveStorage.

## 2. Install and configure ActiveStorage OpenStack

We're going to use the
[ActiveStorage::OpenStack](https://github.com/chaadow/activestorage-openstack)
gem, which adds the openstack swift provider as an ActiveStorage service.

First, adds the gem in your Gemfile.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'activestorage-openstack', '1.0'
{% endhighlight %}

Then run `bundle`.

You can configure the `config/storage.yml` file now:

{% highlight yaml %}
ovh:
  service: OpenStack
  container: 'example-private-bucket'                   # Your bucket's name
  credentials:
    openstack_auth_url: 'https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/'   # URL of the OVH auth url
    openstack_username: OVH_OPENSTACK_USER              # TBD in 2.
    openstack_api_key: OVH_OPENSTACK_PASSWORD           # TBD in 2.
    openstack_region: 'SBG'                             # The region acronym
    openstack_temp_url_key: OVH_OPENSTACK_TEMP_URL_KEY  # TBD in 3.
{% endhighlight %}

And in your environment file (for example in `config/environments/production.rb`):

{% highlight ruby %}
  config.active_storage.service = :ovh
{% endhighlight %}

You can find more information on basic configuration in the [gem's
README](https://github.com/chaadow/activestorage-openstack#installation)

At this point, there's still 2 steps to achieve:

1. Configure a user access to our bucket (for `OVH_OPENSTACK_USER` and
   `OVH_OPENSTACK_PASSWORD` values)
1. Setup the temporary url key (for `OVH_OPENSTACK_TEMP_URL_KEY`)

## 3. Configure user access

Back to the OVH Public Cloud interface: you have to create a new user with an
access to your private bucket.

You can achieve this by clicking on **Users & Roles** link in the side panel.

{% asset 'activestorage-ovh/create-user.png' %}

Click on the **Create User** call to action, then:

1. Add a description (not really important)
1. Add at least **ObjectStore operator** as Role

The new user has been added and should be ready soon. Don't forget to note the
generated password, which we'll be used in our configuration
(you can generate a new password later by
clicking on the three dots at the end of the user line).

{% asset 'activestorage-ovh/user-created-with-password.png' %}

(The password in the screenshot has been obfuscated ofc üôÉ)

At this point, our configuration is (with the credentials extracted from the
screenshot below):

{% highlight yaml %}
ovh:
  service: OpenStack
  container: 'example-private-bucket'                   # Your bucket's name
  credentials:
    openstack_auth_url: 'https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/'   # URL of the OVH auth url
    openstack_username: 'user-sebDztR4d363'             # username created in this section
    openstack_api_key: '28bjtXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'     # password created in this section
    openstack_region: 'SBG'                             # The region acronym
    openstack_temp_url_key: OVH_OPENSTACK_TEMP_URL_KEY  # TBD in 3.
{% endhighlight %}

It remains the temporary url key (`OVH_OPENSTACK_TEMP_URL_KEY` in this config).

## 4. Configure temporary url key

In order to create expiring URLs (required by OpenStack), you have to setup a
temporary url key.

This value has to be choose by you, let's say for the example it'll be
`SuperPrivateKeyOfDoom`.

It can be done with the `swift` client, but it can be done with the
`fog-openstack` gem too (which is a dependency of `activestorage-openstack`,
which is nice).

Here is a working snippet (which required `dotenv` gem, but it can be easily
adapt if you don't use it):

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

unless ARGV.length == 1
  print "Usage: #{$PROGRAM_NAME} temp_url_key\n"
  exit 1
end

require 'dotenv'
Dotenv.load

%w[
  OVH_OPENSTACK_URL
  OVH_OPENSTACK_REGION_NAME
  OVH_OPENSTACK_USER
  OVH_OPENSTACK_PASSWORD
].each do |key|
  if ENV[key].nil?
    print "Required key '#{key}' is missing\n"
    exit 1
  end
end

connection_params = {
  openstack_auth_url:   ENV['OVH_OPENSTACK_URL'],
  openstack_username:   ENV['OVH_OPENSTACK_USER'],
  openstack_api_key:    ENV['OVH_OPENSTACK_PASSWORD'],
  openstack_region:     ENV['OVH_OPENSTACK_REGION_NAME'],
}

require 'fog/openstack'

begin
  connection = Fog::OpenStack::Storage.new(connection_params)
  connection.post_set_meta_temp_url_key(ARGV[0])
  print "OK, please change OVH_OPENSTACK_TEMP_URL_KEY env variable with the following value: #{ARGV[0]}"
rescue Excon::Error::Unauthorized
  print 'Unauthorized, check your credentials'
  exit 2
end
{% endhighlight %}

This snippet is pretty straightforward: it creates a new connection object for
the storage stack, with all of our settings defined below, and set (as [specified by the
gem](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/fog-openstack/0.1.1/Fog/Storage/OpenStack/Real:post_set_meta_temp_url_key))
the **Temp URL key**.

You can run this snippet like this:

{% highlight bash %}
./set_ovh_openstack_temp_url_key.rb SuperPrivateKeyOfDoom
{% endhighlight %}

If the script succeed, you can change the value of `OVH_OPENSTACK_TEMP_URL_KEY`
in your configuration:

{% highlight yaml %}
ovh:
  service: OpenStack
  container: 'example-private-bucket'                   # Your bucket's name
  credentials:
    openstack_auth_url: 'https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/'   # URL of the OVH auth url
    openstack_username: 'user-sebDztR4d363'
    openstack_api_key: '28bjtXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    openstack_region: 'SBG'                             # The region acronym
    openstack_temp_url_key: 'SuperPrivateKeyOfDoom'
{% endhighlight %}

Everything should be up and running now üöÄ

Have a great day üëã
